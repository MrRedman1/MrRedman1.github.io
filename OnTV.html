    <h3><strong>The Witcher on Netflix</strong></h3>
    <p>The Witcher is now sort of a strange trinity of media, as first it was a series of books by author Andrzej Sapkowski, which was adapted into a now famous series of video games made by CD Projekt Red. And now, The Witcher is a hit Netflix show using the books as source material, yet clearly influenced by the video games to some degree, as evidenced by Henry Cavill’s performance as Geralt (with Cavill being a huge gamer and fan of the CDPR titles).</p>
    <p>Now, Sapkowski seems to be in a cheerier mood. He’s struck a new deal with CDPR for future Witcher games which should net him a much bigger piece of the pie. And he seems to really appreciate the Lauren S. Hissirch Netflix adaptation of his books, with specific praise reserved for Henry Cavill.</p>
    <p>“I was more than happy with Henry Cavill’s appearance as The Witcher,” Sapkowski told People. “He’s a real professional. Just as Viggo Mortensen gave his face to Aragorn [in The Lord of the Rings], so Henry gave his to Geralt — and it shall be forever so.”</p>
    <p>Cavill will go down in history as yet another one of those odd casting choices that ended up being perfect in the end. At first it seemed like he was too A-list, too pretty to be the grizzled Geralt, and yet in practice, everyone seems to love him in the role. If you like the show, Cavill’s Geralt is probably one of the main reasons why. And even in reviews that trash the series, you’ll usually hear some phrase like “even Henry Cavill’s Geralt can’t save it,” still giving him his due.</p>
    <p>The Witcher is shaping up to be a potential megahit for Netflix. It’s one of the highest rated shows for the service on IMDB among fans (though critics are being less kind of Rotten Tomatoes), and it has crossed the “will angry gamers be angry about this?” threshold, in that fans of either books or the games seem to be satisfied with the adaptation.</p>
    <p>No, it’s not going to be as big as Game of Thrones. Not now, probably not ever, but that’s too high a bar to set, frankly. But it does seem like it’s going to be a Netflix staple for a while. Season 2 was greenlit before season 1 ever started, and there’s enough source material (or eventually, game material) to probably get to 6, 7, 8 seasons of the series, which would make it downright ancient by Netflix standards (they haven’t even been making original series that long yet). That may be thinking too far ahead, but looking at the other shows that are this highly praised by fans, most of them have 4, 5, 6 seasons at least, with more to come in some cases.</p>
    <p>One common thing I hear after people finish The Witcher is that they wish there was more. Well buckle up, as there will be, and probably will continue to be for years to come, at this rate.</p>
